# advendofcode2023

During this Advent of Code my goal is to complete all days using a different language whilst still being somewhat competetive on a private leaderboard.
I do this to get familiar in multiple laguages previously unknown to me and to hopefully learn some quirks regarding each of them.

**Languages used:**

**Day 1:** PHP
