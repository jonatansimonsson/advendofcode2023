# advendofcode2023

During this Advent of Code my goal is to complete all days using a different language whilst still being somewhat competetive on a private leaderboard.
I do this to get familiar in multiple laguages previously unknown to me and to hopefully learn some quirks regarding each of them.

**Languages used:**

**Day 1:** PHP

**Day 2:** Julia

**Day 3:** Haskell ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ

**Day 4:** Ruby 

**Day 5:** Perl

**Day 6:** GoLang

**Day 7:** PowerShell

**Day 9:** Elixir
